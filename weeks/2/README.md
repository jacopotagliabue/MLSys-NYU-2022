# Week 2

This week, we learned about linear regression and scientific computing.

## Scientific Computing

Inside of the `notebooks` folder, there is a Jupyter notebook called [scientific_computing.ipynb](notebooks/scientific_computing.ipynb) that you can run to learn more about some key scientific computing Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.

You can run the Juptyer notebook as follows:

1. Open up a terminal and navigate to this directory.
2. Create a virtual environment in this folder.
    ```commandline
    python -m venv env
    ```
3. Activate the environment
    ```commandline
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
4. Run Jupyter Lab which is a browser-based interface for viewing and running Jupyter notebooks.
    ```commandline
    jupyter lab
    ```
5. Jupyter Lab should have opened in your web browser. On the left, there is a file directory. Click `notebook`, and the double-click `scientific_computing.ipynb`.

## Homework

See [homework_1.md](homework_1.md) for information about this week's homework assignment.

## Data

There is a housing dataset inside `./data` that's used for both the `scientific_computing` notebook as well as the homework assignment.
