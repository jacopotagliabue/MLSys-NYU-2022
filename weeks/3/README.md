# Week 3

## Feature Engineering and Model Selection.

For further reading about Model Selection, I recommend [Model Evaluation, Model Selection, and Algorithm Selection in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12808) by Sebastian Raschka. Professor Rashcka also has a general [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2021/ml-course.html) course with video lectures and slides which may be helpful.

## Notebooks

- [feature_engineering_and_model_selection.ipynb](./notebooks/feature_engineering_and_model_selection.ipynb) introduces how to perform feature engineering and model selection using `scikit-learn`.
- [slides.ipynb](./notebooks/slides.ipynb) shows how I developed some plots for this week's slides.
