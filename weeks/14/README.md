# Week 14

## Demo day!

How to know you are ready? The checklist in [Week 11](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022/blob/main/weeks/11/Project_checklist.pdf) is a good start, together with the discussions we had in class.

### Presentation rules / guidelines

We have 9 teams, and each will have a max of 12 minutes for presentation and 2 for Q&A.

* Choose one speaker per team and _make sure (by rehearsing many times!) that your presentation is done in 12 minutes_: we will cut your presentation (and grade) if you don't respect the timing.
* Explain clearly the problem, assuming we are not familiar with it: why did you pick it? Why is it important for a business? Why is it hard? If helpful (remember Ciro's lecture), pretend to be actually an employee of the target company (e.g. American Express) building the actual system (e.g. fraud detection): what should you pay attention to?
* Explain clearly the choices you made, but only go deep in the insightful / interesting stuff: do *not* list the features you use, or the steps in your pipeline, but try to tell a story: what did you learn? Did you succeed or was the problem too hard (it is fine if it was, the point here is about building the pipeline!)? Was there something your first tried and then changed? What would you do with more time? Code details are part of the deliverables (see below), but they are not that important for your presentation: assume you are talking to colleagues, and try to communicate just what is essential for them to make them understand / aware of the challenges and your solution (again remember Ciro's lecture!).
* Another way to see this: imagine to present your slides / demo to yourself as you were _when the courses started_ - would you like it? Would you be able to follow the main arguments?
* Your final deliverables to your TA are i) the slides / demo you present in class, and ii) the entire ML project as a stand-alone repository: make sure your repository contains all the necessary ingredients to be understood, reproduced, and evaluated (a thourough README, requirements, screenshot on what to expect on Comet etc.).

Good luck!

### Evaluation criteria for the final project

As per your Syllabus, the Final Project is 30% of the course grade. Your project will be scored by averaging grades on three main dimensions, which reflect the content of the course:

* project structure / coding (evaluated by the TA): the grade reflects how the project is organized and how clear is the coding wrt the aspects we stressed in class: for example, is the README clear? Can the flow be easily reproduced? Are requirements specified? Do functions have types and comments etc.?
* ML (TA): the grade reflects the quality of the data science work to solve the problem: for example, is EDA insightful? Are data tests implemented? Is the model appropriate for the task? How is evaluation performed? Which metrics have been used and why? Are you tracking experiments on Comet etc.?
* Project presentation (Prof. Ethan and Prof. Jacopo for presentation, TA for deployment): the grade reflects the ability to "think end-to-end", that is, going from a challenge you find interesting, to a full ML pipeline that attempts to solve that challenge. Is the problem well explained? Is the choice of data, models, metrics appropriate for the challenge? Is "success" clearly defined? Is the demo compelling? Can the model be used in an app / endpoint etc.?
